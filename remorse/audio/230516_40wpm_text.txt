= NOW 40 WPM = ACCURACY TO AN HP/AGILENT 8722D VNA OVER THE FREQUENCY RANGE COVERED BY THE VNAUHF. HOWEVER, I CANNOT MEASURE FREQUENCIES ABOVE 1200 MHZ WITH THE VNAUHF. FOR THESE MEASUREMENTS, I USED RETURN LOSS INSTEAD OF SWR BECAUSE RETURN LOSS IS THE PREFERRED MEASUREMENT METHOD ON THE HIGHER FREQUENCIES. YOU CAN EASILY CONVERT RETURN LOSS TO SWR USING ONLINE CALCULATORS. FIRST I MEASURED RETURN LOSS USING A PRECISION 50 LOAD SEE TABLE 3 AND THEN I MEASURED SEVERAL OPEN AND SHORTED MICROW PRODUCT REVIEW RIGEXPERT AA 2000 ZOOM 0R1 2000 MHZ ANTENNA AND CABLE ANALYZER REVIEWED BY PHIL SALAS, AD5X THE AA 2000 ZOOM IS RIGEXPERTS LATEST AND MOST CAPABLE ANTENNA ANALYZER. LIKE ALL OF THE RIGEXPERT ANTENNA ANALYZERS, THE AA 2000 ZOOM IS A SINGLE PORT VECTOR NETWORK ANALYZER VNA. IT PROVIDES SIGNED, COMPLEX IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENTS OF RF LOADS FROM 100 KHZ TO 2 GHZ WITH A FREQUENCY RESOLUTION OF 1 KHZ. OVERVIEW THE AA 2000 ZOOM IS A BIT LARGER THAN OTHER ZOOM MODELS. THE MEASUREMENT PORT IS A TYPE N FEMALE CONNECTOR, BUT A UHF TO N ADAPTER IS INCLUDED FOR THE MORE COMMON PL 259 INTERFACE USED BY HAMS IN THE HF AND VHF RANGES. ALSO INCLUDED ARE THE USER MANUAL, A USB CABLE FOR COMPUTER INTERFACING, THREE 2,700 MAH NIMH AA SIZE BATTERIES, AN EXTERNAL NIMH AA SIZE BATTERY CHARGER, A CARRYING CASE, AND A CARRYING STRAP. YOU CAN SUBSTITUTE 1R2 3R7 V LITHIUM OR ALKALINE AA BATTERIES FOR THE NIMH BATTERIES. DEPLETED NIMH BATTERIES TAKE ABOUT 6 HOURS TO CHARGE WITH THE INCLUDED CHARGER, AND A BATTERY INDICATOR ON THE MAIN MENU SHOWS THE BATTERY STATUS. WHEN A COMPUTER IS CONNECTED, POWER IS PROVIDED THOUGH THE USB CONNECTION AND THE BATTERY DISPLAY IS REPLACED BY A USB ICON. INTERNAL MEMORY PROVIDES FOR THE STORAGE AND RECALL OF MEASURED PARAMETERS IN A VARIETY OF FORMATS. ALL INFORMATION IS DISPLAYED ON A 2 X 1R5 INCH, 800 X 480 PIXEL BLANVIEW COLOR TFT LCD SCREEN, WHICH PROVIDES HIGH CONTRAST, CRISP IMAGES EVEN IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. WHEN THE ANALYZER IS CONNECTED TO YOUR COMPUTER, ADDITIONAL DATA RECORDING AND ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS FIRMWARE UPDATES, ARE AVAILABLE. TABLE 1 SUMMARIZES THE AA 2000 ZOOM SPECIFICATIONS. INITIAL SETUP BEFORE USING THE A 2000 ZOOM FOR THE FIRST TIME, VISIT THE RIGEXPERT WEBSITE AND DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL THE ANTSCOPE2 SOFTWARE WINDOWS, MACOS, OR LINUX VERSIONS ARE AVAILABLE AND THE FLASH TOOL FOR WINDOWS OR MACOS. CONNECT THE AA 2000 ZOOM USB CABLE TO YOUR COMPUTER, WHICH AUTOMATICALLY POWERS ON THE AA 2000 ZOOM. NOW OPEN THE DOWNLOADED FLASH TOOL FILE AND THE FLASH TOOL WILL DETERMINE IF THERE IS NEWER FIRMWARE AVAILABLE, AND IF SO WILL UPDATE THE FIRMWARE AUTOMATICALLY. ANTSCOPE2 PERMITS IMPORTING AND VIEWING DATA FROM THE AA 2000 ZOOMS MEMORY AND PROVIDES REAL TIME CONTROL OF THE ANALYZER. AN ANTSCOPE APP IS AVAILABLE FOR ANDROID AND IOS DEVICES. THE AA 2000 ZOOM HAS A BUILT IN BLUETOOTH FEATURE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH MOBILE DEVICES. MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES THE AA 2000 ZOOM MENUS AND KEYPAD MARKINGS ARE SELF EXPLANATORY, SO YOU WILL RARELY NEED TO REFER TO THE MANUAL. THE USER = END OF 40 WPM TEXT = QST DE W1AW
